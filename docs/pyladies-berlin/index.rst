PyLadies is an international mentorship group with a focus on helping more women
become active participants and leaders in the Python open-source community. Our
mission is to promote, educate and advance a diverse Python community through
outreach, education, conferences, events and social gatherings. PyLadies also
aims to provide a friendly support network for women and a bridge to the larger
Python world.
