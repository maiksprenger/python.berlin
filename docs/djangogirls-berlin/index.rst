Django Girls is a non-profit organization that wants to bring more women into
the wonderful world of programming and technology. We are organising free,
one-day workshops for beginners that will teach you how to create a website
using Python and Django. We believe that the IT industry will greatly benefit
from bringing more women into technology. We want to give you an opportunity to
learn how to program and become part of the technology community! Our workshops
are free of charge.
